This App is a tutorial based app where I am trying to build a Web App using Robomate API and deploying it on netlify.
This project uses basics of React basics.
It basically Renders data like name,images,description,etc. from the API and displays it in our app.
You can use the search boc to filter people and click on the card that holds information of that particular robot.
